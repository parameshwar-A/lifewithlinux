Hi There!

I am a novice linux user.
So I explore a lot of stuff in linux. This blog is started to share those explorations and methods I followed to get the job done using linux. 

I am also a huge fan of open source! 
You guessed the next line!
Open source related content will also be here in this blog.

Blog posts are not planned. They are randomly shared based on the things I am currently working on. So If you are looking for something particular try using search or tags section to navigate to your specific needs!

Thanks for taking some of your valuable time to read this blog.
